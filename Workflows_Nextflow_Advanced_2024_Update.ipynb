    "#### Step 3d. Asynchronous and synchronous job execution (or scatter-gather pattern)\n",
    "\n",
    "Scatter-gather pattern is an important pattern in pipelining. The concept of this is that we want to split (\"scatter\") out entries on a fasta file or rows in a samplesheet for parallel execution and on any downstream jobs asynchronously (on as many nodes as possible on `OSCAR`). \n",
    "\n",
    "Then in the end of pipeline, we would like to aggregate (\"gather\") these results; for example, \n",
    " - In RNASeq, to sum up or contrast the gene expressions of the `wild-type` replicates against the `treatment` replicates\n",
    " - In metagenomics workflows, to summarize the overall distribution or diversity of all the samples in a data-set.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "Continuing with our toy example of document counting, we now would like to demonstrate this concept by simply gathering all of the individual counts (whether by letter or by words) and summing all of them togethe to give an overall total count. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Add a variable `count_result` which is an synchronous collection/`collect()` of all the scattered or asynchronous runs of `COUNT_DOCUMENT`:\n",
    "\n",
    "By defining a variable to hold onto `COUNT_DOCUMENT(documents_ch).collect()`, we are essentially assigning `count_results` as the gather-step's result placeholder. In other words, we will wait for all `COUNT_DOCUMENTS` to finish, and all individual document counts to be gathered into `count_results` and then run the final gather step of `sum_all_results(count_results)`. \n",
